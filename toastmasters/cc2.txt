Do you know what's special about this month? Any one? Any one at all 
<Swirling your moustache> Yes, that's correct. It's Movember. 
Mo stands for moustache and vember for november.
Do you know how it started? Let me tell you! 
So, there was this dude and there was this another dude. Both of them are 
good friends. One fine day, they met each other at a bar and started drinking beer
and talking about random things. 
So one dude says to another <in australian accent>, we haven't done anything this year. It's
already November and the year is about to end.
He shouts again , Dude! Dude! . The other dude was trying a stare at one of the hotties that 
endered the bar. Typical. The first dude , loosing patience slaps the other dude. <wuh-PSSSH>As a result , the
sauce from the french fries the second dude rubs above his upper lip. It looked like a moustache!!!!
<Pause><Deep voice> My fellow audience, the scene where I ended the story is not an ordinary scene. It has been
repeated in history, when Archimedes ran naked in the city shouting "Euraka", when an apple fell on Newton's head, 
when Mark Zuckerberg headed home after being bumped by his girlfriend. 
Needless to say, the Movember movement started by the first dude became an instant hit. It started out as a fun event, where
fellow Mobros celebrated Movember with a moustache party at the end of the month. 
It soon became really famous that Adam Garone, none other than our first dude, came up with an idea of tieing up with a cause.
Through the power of the moustache, awareness and funds are raised for menâ€™s health, specifically prostate and testicular cancer initiatives.

Enough of the serious part, now let's get to some fun facts about growing a moustache:-
Fun Fact #1 (how moustache melts girls heart away. Say it in a cheesy way)
Fun Fact #2 
Fun Fact #3 

Before I conclude, I request all you guys to grow a moustache and become a MoBro and all you gals to
support your male pals and become a MoSista
